/*  
    std::cout is the “character output stream”. It is pronounced “see-out”.
    << is an operator that comes right after it.
    "Hello World!\n" is what’s being outputted here. You need double quotes around text. The \n is a special character that indicates a new line.
    ; is a punctuation that tells the computer that you are at the end of a statement. It is similar to a period in a sentence.
