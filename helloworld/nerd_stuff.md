## Understanding Pre-Processor Directives

In C++, pre-processor directives are instructions that are processed by the compiler before the actual compilation of your code. One of the essential libraries often included using these directives is the `iostream` library.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

### What is `iostream`?

The `iostream` library contains code that facilitates input and output operations. This includes:

- **Displaying Data**: Outputting data to the terminal window.
- **Reading Input**: Capturing user input from the keyboard.

By including the `iostream` library, you gain access to objects like `std::cout` for outputting data and `std::cin` for reading user input, which simplifies interaction with your program's users.
