#include <iostream>

int main(){
    //default int
    int a =-23;//int can take both +ve and -ve input

    //variants of int
    /*
    signed int (default): Can store negative and positive values.
    means up is the example we dont need to write signed int always int does everything)
    */


    //unsigned int
    unsigned int b=90;//Only stores positive values.

    //short int
    short c=90;//Smaller range, less memory. also we can write short int c=90; would mean the same

    //long int
    long d = 1234567890;//Larger range, possibly more memory.



    //Modifiers
    //we can use unsigned before int,long,short to make it only +ve

    /*
    for ex-
    unsigned long int: Larger range with positive values only.
    unsigned int: Only stores positive values.
