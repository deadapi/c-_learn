## Understanding the C++ Development Process

C++ is a compiled language. This means that to run a C++ program, you need to translate it from a human-readable form into machine code that the computer can understand. This translation is performed by a program called a compiler.

### Development Phases

When working with C++, you typically go through the following phases during development:

1. **Code** — Write your C++ program using a text editor or IDE.
2. **Save** — Save your program file to ensure your changes are stored.
3. **Compile** — Use a compiler to translate your code into machine code. This step is usually performed via the terminal or command line.
4. **Execute** — Run the compiled program to see the results. This step is also done via the terminal or command line.

### Workflow

You will often repeat these steps, especially if you need to debug and fix errors:

1. **Code** — Write or modify your code.
2. **Save** — Save your changes.
3. **Compile** — Compile the updated code.
4. **Execute** — Run the program to test your changes.
